Scope of this document:
=======================

This document is meant to be a walk-through guide for people who want to build 
rpm packages from a pre-tagged `CMSDIST` area using `cmsBuild`.

Before you start:
-----------------

Make sure you have a working building environment, which includes things like 
make, perl, autoconf, X11 and their development packages. Notably you'll also 
need the 32 bit compatibility environment if you plan to build 32bit over 64bit
OS.

Building packages using cmsBuild
================================

`cmsBuild` can be used with a workflow very similar to the one of the old 
`install.sh`:

* Setup some frequently used variables.
* Bootstrap an area.
* _source_ the environment (`init.sh`) for apt.
* checkout PKGTOOLS
* checkout CMSDIST
* Invoke cmsBuild via 
    
        PKGTOOLS/cmsBuild
