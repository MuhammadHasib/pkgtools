Installing software
===================

Now that you (or someone else) have built your packages you most likely want
to actually use them. In order to do so, first define some helper environment
variables.

    export SCRAM_ARCH=slc4_ia32_gcc345
    # On macosx leopard:
    # export SCRAM_ARCH=osx105_ia32_gcc401
    export REPOSITORY=geTest
    # For webtools nightlies
    # export REPOSITORY=geTest.eulisse
    export WORKAREA=/some/work/dir
    # E.g.
    # export WORKAREA=`pwd`

Then you need to fetch and run the bootstrap (only **ONCE**).

    mkdir -p $WORKAREA
    # FIXME: use cms rather than geTest
    wget -O$WORKAREA/bootstrap.sh http://cmsrep.cern.ch/cmssw/geTest/bootstrap.sh
    # On macosx wget is not installed by default, use curl:
    # curl http://cmsrep.cern.ch/cmssw/geTest/bootstrap.sh > $WORKAREA/bootstrap.sh
    sh $WORKAREA/bootstrap.sh -path $WORKAREA -arch $SCRAM_ARCH -repository $REPOSITORY setup
    
You can bring apt-get in your environment by sourcing the appropriate init.sh / init.csh

    . $WORKAREA/$SCRAM_ARCH/external/apt/0.5.15lorg3.2-cms/etc/profile.d/init.sh
    # On tcsh
    source $WORKAREA/$SCRAM_ARCH/external/apt/0.5.15lorg3.2-cms/etc/profile.d/init.csh
    apt-get update
    
And the use the usual apt command to install/remove and query packages.

    apt-get update                  # To update the apt database
    apt-get install <package-name>  # To install package <package-name>
    apt-get remove <package-name>   # To remove package <package-name>
    apt-cache search <expression>   # To search for packages matching <expression>
