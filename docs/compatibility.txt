cmsBuild should be 100% compatible with a CMSDIST tag, at least for what
concerns the `spec` files themselves. The only difference is in the
`rpm-preamble.file` file which has to be updated to the latest/greatest
version in order to have cmsBuild work.
Notice however than for some of the packages we have in CMSDIST the
original authors do not provide sources anymore and therefore cmsBuild will
fail to download them.
