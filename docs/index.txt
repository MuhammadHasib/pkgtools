Introduction:
=============

cmsBuild is a python rewrite of the old [install.sh][installsh] script. It retains 
almost [100% compatibility][compatibility] with the old script and 
fixes all the design bugs of the old version.

Nomenclature:
-------------

Before you read, a little bit of nomenclature:

  * _package group_ refers to the first item in the `### RPM` header of the spec file
  * _package name_ refers to the second item in the `### RPM` and it's usually the
                   name of the software being packaged (e.g. gcc, python, root) 
  * _package version_ refers to the third item in the `### RPM` header and it's
                   the version of the software as provided by the original author,
                   *without* any cms appended label.
  * _package label_ is an additional label appended to the package version, which
                   identifies different builds of the same version of the software
                   (e.g. -CMS2, -CMS3, -XXX, -wt).
                   While in the past it was user decided, now the system is able
                   to automatically determine which is the best label to use.

New Features:
-------------

  * Correct detection of which packages have to be rebuild and which not after
    a given spec is modified.
  * Configuration management.
  * Automatic labels for packages with same version but different spec. 
  * Consistency checks for the build area.
  * Integrated upload command.
  * Parallel build of externals.
  * Build can be driven from configuration files.
  
Solved issues:
--------------

  * Now sources can be shared among different packages with same version but 
    different labels  

Documentation:
==============

[The cmsBuild userguide][userguide] addresses how you use cmsBuild with a pre-tagged CMSDIST
area. 
If you are interested in developing new specs you probably want to look 
at the [cmsBuild Developer Guide][devguide]
There is also a [cmsBuild Reference Guide][refguide] which contains a summary 
of all the cmsBuild commands and a description of all the options that can be 
specified in a configuration file.
