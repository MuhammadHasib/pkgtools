cmsBuild build
==============

SYNOPSIS
--------

    cmsBuild [global-options] build [build options] --cfg <configuration-file>
    cmsBuild [global-options] build [build options] <package name>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The build command is used to actually build packages.

OPTIONS
-------

Possible options which are specific to this command are:

* `--cfg <file path>`: the location of the configuration file to be used for 
                       building. For the file syntax have a look at the
                       [configuration documentation][config].
* `--work-dir <path>`: path to the directory to use for all the 
  build operations.
* `--pretend`: only prints what will be done, does not actually build stuff.
* `--do-not-bootstrap`: does not try too source the bootstrap environment 
  before building.
* `--tag <tag>`: tells cmsBuild to append `tag` to packages which have the same
                 group, name and version of another one but that use a different
                 spec. The system will also add and increasing integer number 
                 which reflects the number of times a package has been 
                 successfully built. A description on how the whole tagging 
                 works can be found [here][tagging]. 
* `--test-tag`: always adds a tag to a given package, even if the combination 
                of group, package name and package version was never built 
                before. This option has to be used in conjunction with the 
                "test" option and it's useful for example for test packages 
                which could always have a "-testXXX" appended to their name.
                A description on how the whole tagging works can be found 
                [here][tagging].
