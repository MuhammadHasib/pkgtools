cmsBuild fetch
==================

SYNOPSIS
--------

    cmsBuild [global-options] fetch [--pretend] package-name

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The fetch command is used to download all the files necessary to build a given 
package `package-name` and all its dependencies.
In particular in the case you don't have a working area you can use the following
command

    cmsBuild --do-not-bootstrap --cmsdist-tag <some tag> fetch package-name

to create a copy of the sources to be downloaded in $PWD/SOURCES.

OPTIONS
-------

Possible options which are specific to this command are:

* `--pretend`: do not actually fetch the files but prints out from where they 
  will be fetched.
