SYNOPSIS
========

    cmsBuild [options] deprecate-local <full-package-name>

Where `<full-package-name>` is the name of the package including its group, 
its version and it's label, e.g.:

    cms+cmssw+CMSSW_1_2_3-CMS3

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `deprecate-local` command removes any reference about a given package and 
its dependencies from the local build area. This includes:

* Any rpm packages in `RPMS` and `RPMS/cache`.
* Any installed packages in the local rpm db.
  
The `deprecate-local` command is expected to be used in two occasions:

* when a mistake is done and a new build of the same version of a given 
  package has to be done using a slightly different spec/cmsBuild. This 
  will usually trigger a new label because a package with a similar label 
  but a different checksum is found. If the original package is not uploaded 
  to the server, yet, using `deprecate-local` one can remove any reference 
  to it hence the new package is allowed to reused the now unused label.

* if two persons are working on different aspects of the same package and 
  one of the uploads his package to the original server this will cause a 
  conflict with the area of the other person which has already a packages 
  named that way. The conflict can be resolved by deprecating the local 
  package via `deprecate-local` and rebuilding: cmsBuild will now notice that 
  the given label was already assigned to some package in the repository and
  will use a new one.
