Possible options which are specific to this command are:

* `--repository <repository name>`: the repository to be used by `apt` (the one 
    referred in `$APT_ROOT/etc/sources.lists`). By default it uses `cms`.
* `--path <directory>`: the path in which to effectuate the bootstrap.
* `--architecture <architecture name>`: the architecture you want to use for the bootstrap.
