SYNOPSIS
========

    cmsBuild [global-options] check <package-name>

DESCRIPTION
===========

The check command is used to verify the integrity of the build area when
considering a given package. It does so by figuring out what should have
happened and what should have not in the building process (fetching of the
sources, fetching of a pre build dependency). Notice that _package-name_ has
to be the name of the package without the group and its version because
`cmsBuild` will also make sure that the spec file that you have in CMSDIST is
the same which was used to build the rpm.
