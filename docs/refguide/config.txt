cmsBuild Configuration files
============================

Configuration files are of the form

    # Comment
    # Optional section with global options.
    [globals]
    # Boolean option
    globalOption1: True
    # Numeric option
    globalOption2: 1
    # String option
    globalOption3: Some string
    [command1]
    # Option relevant for command1 execution only 
    option: value
    [command2]
    # Option relevant for command2 execution only 
    option: anotherValue

Notice that options defined in the `[globals]` section apply to all the other
sections and override command-line ones (i.e. command-line options are for
_untracked parameters_).

Option specified in any other sections are specific to the section they are in
and the override both command-line ones and the ones specified in the globals
section .

By default sections are all at the same level and the order they are specified
is not necessarily the one in which `cmsBuild` will carry them out. If some
sections need to be executed before others, you can specify it's priority by
using the `priority` option. Lower values for priority get executed before any
higher value one. No higher priority value sections will start before **all**
the lower value are successfully completed.
